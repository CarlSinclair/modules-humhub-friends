## Description
Adds a widget that shows a list of user's friends. 

This widget is part 2/5 of my plan to disable the default member/subscriber/friends/spaces/followers widgets and then add that functionality back via modules that users and spaces can opt-in to enable. And most importantly, along with a permission of who can see the widget.

### TODO
- Make the module actually work
- Fix config to allow space admins to set max users visible in the widget

### Works with
- Humhub version 1.4
- PHP 7.2
